t's important to choose a LICENSE.
Choosing a license is an important task, as it decides the future of your product beyond your ambitions for the project. Giving a product a freer license, open to derivation and branching projects, can breathe life into the project for far longer than a restrictive license, which can transform the product in its entirety in the long term. Similarly, a project without a clearly defined license will be in the dark, where somebody willing to edit or build off of a project may be hesitant due to unclear conditions.

Why SHOULDN'T you use a project without a license.
Working on a project without an explicitly defined license is a terrible idea for many reasons, most notably the fact that your work will very possibly be prohibited in the future. For the time being, derivative or remixed works may be in the clear on an unlicensed product, but the author(s) of the original product are still free to apply a license of any kind, which can possibly invalidate your work. 

Failure to follow the Open System Model
The overarching claim of the section that I could derive is that once a project establishes an open systems model, it'll have to stick with it. Gopher's decision to move away from the model with licensing fees for .com domains but not .edu domains ultimately signaled not just one small change in the project's profit plan, but showed a shift in the work and product ethics of the Gopher team. From this, it failed to garner the proper support it needed in its earlier stages, as it "violated the hacker ethic", turning many crucial contributors away, forcing the project into a situation where it relied on outside work, as per standard open system projects, but failed to follow all its guidelines, resulting in an uncentralized project with an unclear future. This is a perfetly valid reason to follow the model your project chooses. Especially in the case of the open system model, getting the worker base your project needs is essential in its early stages, so to go against the open system model was a clear downfall of the Gopher project, and any project that follows in its footsteps.

Sailfish OS
Jolla's decision to keep Sailfish OS partially closed-source for the time being is a controversial decision due to its Linux roots, but it's attributes give some reason for keeping it as so. One major point of Sailfish (from what I can tell) is its UI, which largely depends on one or a few user's decisions. It's a more artistic choice than a technical, so allowing the general public to work on it would potentially cause a style mismatch, which could be detrimental.

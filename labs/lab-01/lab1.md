Smart Questions: Respond simply if the question can be; don't give a wall of acronyms and hard to understand data to a simple question, just because you can. Answering a question shouldn't be a way to flex your knowledge, but a way to help another. Keep it at the same level as the question. That being said, one also shouldn't simplify their answer if the answer really is as complicated as it is. Assumptions on the user's setup or previous steps shouldn't be taken, and while an optimal solution may be simple and straightforward, leave complexities if its really needed.
Free Culture: The lawsuit on Jesse is certainly a terrifying one, one that I fear could eventually fall into my hands. I've got a large interest in big data; taking and spreading data to analyze and understand systems and databases in a better light, and eventually possibly even create widespread ways for average users to do it themselves. I do believe that Jesse had no interaction with pirates whatsoever, simply working on and letting his peers use his search engine, but I also believe that he was a bit negligent with no form of data filter. If there exists an underground method to spread data with malicious intent, it will likely be abused, and that's exactly what happened here. I do feel bad for Jesse and his family, yet I also feel it was somewhat important for the case to happen, as it set an example of not only how to approach projects such as Jesse's, but showed the relentlessness of copyright holders to enforce this, even going so far as to destroy students entire careers. It's a cruel truth, but one all creators must understand in the modern age if they wish to coexist peacefully with other content creators. That being said, it's a bit unfortunate that Jesse's improved search engine happened to run into this issue; while I may accept the fact that the RIAA had the right to file this lawsuit, I hate that it got in the way of improvement. Warning taken, but it would be a wonderful world if an organization like the RIAA would put a minor piracy scheme aside for a great system like this to be improved upon, eventually even having their issue fixed. It's important for the creator to be careful with their program, patching out any possible abuses like piracy, but the excessiveness of the hurt organization's reaction is an injustice in itself.

Reflection: I've seen a lot of content taken directly from Wikipedia, but rarely do I see any form of analysis on the wiki as a whole. I've been interested to see this information for quite some time, and while I may be unqualified to perform intense analysis (I don't have the most powerful computer in the world), I would like to provide a dynamic platform to analyze data based on provided data dumps from Wikipedia and other wiki pages. This works well as an open source project, as others that may catch interest in the project could have the computational strength to compute higher level analysis, giving a much better platform to expand, and allowing the project to keep up with improving computational power over time.
